              I started the journey towards web developemnt when I was enrolled
              in UET Lahore. I was enrolled in Electrical Engineering programme.
              UET is one of the best institue in Pakistan for engineering
              degree. I started the basic HTML and CSS structures as soon as I
              was enrolled in university.

              It's been one year since I started my joueney towards programming
              and development. I have learned the C language and Pythin in one
              year. I also joined the IET EE On Campus community to grow the
              basic knowledge of the programming and embedded systems.

            <p>
              Halfway throught the engineering, this was the best year where I
              studied the Python, Java OOP and Data Structures. This was going
              to be the foundation of the start that I was going to take in the
              next year.

              Landed on my first project based on the front-end design of an
              eCommerce store. This was the year when I learned the MATLAB and

              Started working with the local start up to build solutions for
              IOT. I worked on multiple projects to build the front-ends of the
              websites and backend links. In this startup, at the end , I moved
              completely to the front-end and direction was set. Shopify
              development is at its peek. Final project at university is also
              going at rapid pace. Loved the momentum of things until Coivd-19
              strike. Due to covid, I got a window to work more exclusively on
              my skills and keep building on shopify and ReactJS
